# 10 Hours Lab

## Motivation

> This is a simple React Frontend server powered by a GraphQL Backend Server

## Running the backend Service

First, Start the provided GraphQL Backend server on localhost, port 8080. (Inportant)

````sh
npm install json-graphql-server -g

```sh
json-graphql-server db.js --p 8080
````

To use a port other than 3000, you can run `json-graphql-server db.js --p <your port here>`
To use a host other than localhost, you can run `json-graphql-server db.js --h <your host here>`

Then Start up the React front end service, (dafault port 3000)

## Clone this Repo

```sh
git clone
```

## Install

```sh
npm install or yarn
```

## run the front end server

```sh
 yarn run start
```

## Then, we can now Enjoy the service on in browser
